# Digital Image Processing 
Assignment #4

Due: Tue 05/11/21 11:59 PM

**Filtering:**

Write code for computing Median, Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean, Adaptive Local Noise reduction and Adaptive Median filters. 
The input to your program is a 2D matrix.

  - Starter code available in directory Denoise/
      - \__init__(): Will intialize the required variable for filtering (image, filter_name, filter_size). There is no need to edit this function  
  - Denoise/Filtering.py: Edit the functions 'get_median_filter', 'get_arithmetic_mean', 'get_geometric_mean', 'get_local_noise', and 'get_adaptive_mean'. you are welcome to add more function.
  - For this part of the assignment, please implement your own code for all computations, do not use built-in functions, like "medianBlur", "MaxFilter", "numpy.pad" from PIL, opencv or other libraries - that directly accomplish the objective of the question. You can use any math (import math) related functions such as "prod", "pow" and "sum".
    You can also make use python builtin functions such as "sorted", "max", "min", "median" for order statistic filters.   
  
filtering(): Write your code to perform image denoising/filtering here using the previous implemented filters. All the variable have already been initialized and can be used as self.image, self.filter_name, etc. The variable self.filter is a handle to each of the five filter functions. 
  - The function return the denoised image.
  - This part of the assignment can be run using dip_hw_filter.py (there is no need to edit this file)
  - Usage: 
  
        ./dip_hw_filter.py -f median -i Lenna.png -n gaussian
        python dip_hw_filter.py -f median -i Lenna.png -n gaussian
        
  - Please make sure your code runs when you run the above command from prompt/terminal
  - Any output images or files must be saved to "output/" folder (dip_hw_filter.py automatically does this)
  - One image is provided for testing: Lenna.png

**Grayscale to color conversion:**

Write code to convert a grayscale image into a color image using the two techniques covered in class: Color slicing and Intensity to color tranformation using a rectified sine wave function. 
The input to your program is a 2D matrix.

  - Starter code available in directory Coloring/
  - Coloring/Coloring.py: Edit the functions 'intensity_slicing', and 'color_transformation' you are welcome to add more function.
  - For this part of the assignment, please implement your own code for all computations, do not use built-in functions  from PIL, opencv or other libraries - that directly accomplish the objective of the question. You can use math and random related functions.
 
    
color_slicing(image, n_slices):
    - Write code to tranform greyscale image to color image using intensity slicing. 
    - The function returns the colored image.

color_transformation(image, n_slices, theta): 
    - Write code to tranform greyscale image to color image using intensity to color transformation using rectified sin waves.
    - The function returns the colored image.

  - This part of the assignment can be run using dip_hw_color.py (there is no need to edit this file)
  - Usage: 
  
        ./dip_hw_color -i cat.jpg -n 5
        python dip_hw_color.py -i cat.jpg -n 5
        
  - Please make sure your code runs when you run the above command from prompt/terminal
  - Any output images or files must be saved to "output/" folder (dip_hw_color.py automatically does this)
  - Multiple images are available for testing (cat.jpg, Medical.PNG, pluto.jpg, and luggage.jpeg)

PS. Files not to be changed: requirements.txt and Jenkins file 
  
1. Any output file or image should be written to output/ folder

The TA will only be able to see your results if these condition is met

1. Filtering       - 75 Pts.
2. Coloring        - 75 Pts.
 
    Total          - 150 Pts.
